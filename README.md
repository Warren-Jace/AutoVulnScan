# AutoVulnScan

## Introduction

AutoVulnScan is an intelligent and automated vulnerability scanning system designed for efficient and accurate discovery of security vulnerabilities in web applications. It leverages a powerful crawling engine, dynamic analysis capabilities, and a modular plugin system to provide comprehensive security testing.

## Core Features

- **Intelligent Crawler**: Combines static and dynamic crawling techniques to discover a wide range of URLs, including those generated by JavaScript in modern single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Utilizes a headless browser (Chrome) to render pages, execute JavaScript, and analyze the DOM, enabling the detection of complex vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS.
- **Accurate Vulnerability Verification**: Confirms vulnerabilities by listening for browser events (e.g., `alert` dialogs), resulting in near-zero false positives.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Highly configurable through a `config.yaml` file, allowing users to fine-tune scanning behavior, including scope, concurrency, and target-specific settings.
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Easily extendable with new plugins to scan for a variety of vulnerabilities (e.g., SQLi, XSS, SSRF).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher
- A running Chrome or Chromium instance (for dynamic crawling)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/autovulnscan.git
cd autovulnscan
go build ./cmd/autovulnscan
```

### Usage

The primary way to use AutoVulnScan is through the `scan` command, which takes a target URL as input.

#### Basic Scan

```bash
./autovulnscan scan -u http://example.com
```

#### Command-Line Help

For a full list of commands and options, use the `--help` flag.

```bash
./autovulnscan --help
./autovulnscan scan --help
```

## Configuration

AutoVulnScan uses a `config.yaml` file for detailed configuration. While the default settings are suitable for most use cases, you can customize them to fit your needs.

### Key Configuration Options

- **Target**: Define the scan scope, including allowed domains, blacklists, and cookies.
- **Scanner**: Control the scanner's behavior, such as concurrency, timeouts, crawl depth, and which parameter positions to test.
- **Dynamic Crawler**: Enable or disable the headless browser and configure its behavior.
- **Reporting**: Specify the output paths for vulnerability reports and discovered URLs.

For a full list of configuration options, please refer to the `config.yaml` file.
